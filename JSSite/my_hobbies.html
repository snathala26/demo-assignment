        <li>ProgrammingCoding has been my hobby for many years; hence, I became a computer science-based student. It fills my heart with bliss when the process of developing a working piece of code as my ideas obtain form and complex problem solving is carried with the help of logical thinking and algorithmic solutions. From creating websites or even recognizing faces, programs give you the infinite field of wide range of creativity, which is inexhaustible!</p></li></ol>
