    <h1>My Hometown</h1>
    <p>Being from the traditional town of Warangal, which falls in the Telangana state in India, I am overwhelmed with pride. Warangal is a city of cultural legacies where guideposts lead to glimpses of the history that is 9 centuries old. This is going to be a place for me to display some of the cool, defining landmarks in my town which separate it from all others.</p>
